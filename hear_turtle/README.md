# 💗 Heart turtle Project

A simple Python project that uses the turtle library to draw a heart made of lines starting from the center to the edges,  
with a smooth pink gradient from light to dark.

## 🧠 Idea
This project is based on the mathematical heart curve.  
Each line starts from the origin (0,0) and extends to a point on the heart shape,  
while the color gradually darkens to create a soft gradient effect.
